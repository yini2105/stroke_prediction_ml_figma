# Stroke Risk Prediction (Machine Learning)
This project explores stroke risk prediction using a supervised machine learning approach on a public healthcare dataset.

## Overview
- Dataset: Healthcare Stroke Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)
- Task: Binary classification (stroke vs no stroke)
- Model: Logistic Regression

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling class imbalance using class weighting
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Stratified train-test split
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Key Focus
This project emphasises correct data handling, interpretability, and healthcare relevance over model complexity.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Improvements
- ROC-AUC evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Simple user-facing risk explanation interface (Figma)
